# dom-plus

A custom version of the original shiva project (https://github.com/gabrielmccallin/shiva).

## Why another JavaScript library?

Having used AngularJS, Vue, React and tried out a number other popular libraries/frameworks. It is quite tiresome to be constantly adapting to new library/framework specific APIs changes, new "best practices" and etc. The goal of this library is to:

* To be an abstraction layer between developers and vanilla DOM APIs. Simplify how developers interacts with the DOM, not introducing more complexity.
* Ultilise component based implementation compared to vanilla DOM and jQuery APIs.
* Write CSS in JS, which means it is now possible to unit test CSS styles.
* Less APIs to learn, and keep API changes to a minimal.
